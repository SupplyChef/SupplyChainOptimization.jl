SupplyChainOptimization.jl is a package for modeling and optimizing supply chains. 

Use built-in constructs to easily model your supply chain and use powerful solvers to optimize it.

Learn more by reading the [documentation](https://SupplyChef.github.io/SupplyChainOptimization.jl/dev).

**New:** [Maturation scheduling](https://SupplyChef.github.io/SupplyChainOptimization.jl/dev/maturation%20scheduling/) models any supply chain where a batch's *value* grows while it's held — poultry
weight, cheese aging, wine maturation — and must be shipped to meet a periodic delivery quota. See the
[case study](CASE_STUDY.md) for a worked example replicating a published academic model.
